# Whitelist Integration Guide

## Your Current Whitelist Data

You have **2 whitelisted users** with the following allocations:

```json
[
  {
    "publicKey": "ACcBs3ayGMsZzQoNtM3sVdwAVkuYJotWhWXAc42d3FQZ",
    "account": {
      "userAddress": "7MPW5D3fv8RN9a95CdEHfym3x8MqWG9TfQQfsns2tiFj",
      "total": "15000",
      "claim": "0",
      "remain": "15000",
      "lastWithdrawAt": "0",
      "lastWithdrawTreasuryAt": "0"
    }
  },
  {
    "publicKey": "kwgYQ3Uxf4mCbYHf6c7ERd9S7Jfg6KKj4Np9WYZChpK",
    "account": {
      "userAddress": "7TvGfZfUUvMhZp1SNGvfReHFqmmc7E1wepvB76cZKk8s",
      "total": "15000",
      "claim": "0",
      "remain": "15000",
      "lastWithdrawAt": "0",
      "lastWithdrawTreasuryAt": "0"
    }
  }
]
```

## Summary

- **Total Users**: 2
- **Total Allocated**: 30,000 SOSANA
- **Total Claimed**: 0 SOSANA
- **Total Remaining**: 30,000 SOSANA
- **Status**: Both users ready to claim (no claims made yet)

## Integration with Vesting System

### 1. **User Eligibility Check**

The vesting page now checks if a connected wallet is in the whitelist:

```typescript
// In vesting page
const isWhitelisted = whitelistData !== null;
```

**For your whitelisted users:**
- ✅ Will see vesting status and claim button
- ✅ Can claim daily drips once vesting starts
- ✅ Will see their allocation amounts

**For non-whitelisted users:**
- ❌ Will see "Not Eligible for Airdrop" message
- ❌ Will see eligibility requirements
- ❌ Claim button will be disabled

### 2. **Daily Drip Calculation**

Each user gets daily drips based on their allocation:

```typescript
// Example for 15,000 SOSANA allocation
// Month 2: 8% = 1,200 SOSANA
// Daily: 1,200 ÷ 30 days = 40 SOSANA per day
```

### 3. **Claim Process**

When users claim:
1. System checks if they're whitelisted
2. Calculates available amount for today
3. Transfers tokens from team pool to user
4. Updates `lastWithdrawAt` timestamp
5. Reduces `remain` amount

## Files Created

### 1. **`src/utils/whitelistUtils.ts`**
- Utility functions for working with whitelist data
- Validation and parsing functions
- Your sample data included

### 2. **`src/components/admin/WhitelistDataViewer.tsx`**
- Admin component to view whitelist data
- Summary statistics
- User details and status
- Validation results

### 3. **`src/app/admin/whitelist-test/page.tsx`**
- Test page to view your whitelist data
- Access at `/admin/whitelist-test`

## How to Use

### 1. **View Whitelist Data**
Visit `/admin/whitelist-test` to see your whitelist data in action.

### 2. **Add More Users**
Use the existing admin panel at `/admin/wallets` to add more users to the whitelist.

### 3. **Test User Experience**
Connect with one of your whitelisted wallet addresses:
- `7MPW5D3fv8RN9a95CdEHfym3x8MqWG9TfQQfsns2tiFj`
- `7TvGfZfUUvMhZp1SNGvfReHFqmmc7E1wepvB76cZKk8s`

### 4. **Test Non-Whitelisted User**
Connect with any other wallet to see the "Not Eligible" message.

## Next Steps

### 1. **Initialize Team Vesting**
- Go to `/admin/vesting`
- Initialize team vesting with your total allocation
- Set the start time for vesting

### 2. **Set Environment Variables**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_TEAM_ACCOUNT=your_team_account_public_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_VESTING_PROGRAM_ID=your_vesting_program_id
```

### 3. **Test the Full Flow**
1. Initialize team vesting
2. Connect with whitelisted wallet
3. Verify countdown timer shows
4. Test claim functionality once vesting starts

## Monitoring

### Admin Dashboard
- View total allocations and claims
- Monitor user claim activity
- Track remaining tokens

### User Experience
- Clear eligibility status
- Real-time claim availability
- Transparent vesting schedule

## Troubleshooting

### "Not Eligible" for Whitelisted User
1. Check if wallet address matches exactly
2. Verify whitelist data is loaded
3. Check console for errors

### Claim Button Disabled
1. Ensure vesting has started
2. Check if user already claimed today
3. Verify team vesting is initialized

### Data Not Loading
1. Check environment variables
2. Verify smart contract is deployed
3. Check network connection

## Security Notes

- Whitelist is immutable once set
- Only admin can add/remove users
- All transactions are on-chain and verifiable
- No manual overrides possible
